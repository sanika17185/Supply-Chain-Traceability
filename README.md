# Supply-Chain-Traceability
The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the primary regulatory authority overseeing food safety and its purpose is to protect public health and maintain an approach to addressing foodborne outbreaks. The FDA holds the responsibility for safeguarding food safety within the United States, employing a range of strategies to manage outbreaks effectively. Through the utilization of systems such as FORS, they conduct thorough investigations to ascertain the origins of contamination, swiftly implementing measures such as recalls or inspections to mitigate associated risks. Additionally, the FDA prioritizes preventative actions by enforcing rigorous standards and promoting cooperation with the food industry to ensure adherence to regulations. This proactive stance, combined with collaboration between agencies, highlights their dedication to upholding the integrity of the food supply chain.

In conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) existing system Foodborne Outbreaks Response and Surveillance Network (FORS), the regulatory landscape is further fortified by the FSMA Final Rule Requirements for Additional Traceability Records for Certain Foods, thereby guaranteeing traceability across the supply chain. This regulation along with FDA existing systems establish protocols ensuring traceability both forward and backward within the food supply chain. The primary purpose behind these requirements is to prepare for and respond effectively in the event of a foodborne outbreak, underscoring the FDA's commitment to enhancing traceability measures for the protection of public health.

The presence of contaminated food presents a significant hazard, often resulting in illness. The occurrence of multiple illnesses stemming from the consumption of the same tainted food constitutes an outbreak. Statistics reveal that approximately one in six individuals falls victim to illness in such outbreaks, leading to an estimated 3,000 deaths annually. Our project endeavors to enhance public health by closely monitoring supply chain data associated with these outbreaks.
